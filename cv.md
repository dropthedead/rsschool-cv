## About myself
I started my career as Marine Engineer, worked in there for over 6 years, travelling across the whole world
on different vessels with different nations and people, which helped a lot with english skill and made me strong
and extremely stress-resistant.

But since high school I used to spend a lot of time with my PC, wondering some day it may become my job.
Also in high school started learning VBA just for myself, because of curiosity reasons.

Nowadays I have decided that programming is my way.

## Skills (all basics)
* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript
* Git

## Code example
**Task from CODEWARS. Square sum of Array elements**

```javascript
function squareSum(numbers){
  let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  sum += numbers[i]**2;
}
  return sum;
}
console.log(squareSum([1,2]));
```
